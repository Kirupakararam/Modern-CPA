# Modern-CPA
Build a website (just one page) using Framer for a fictitious US based CPA firm - say "Modern CPA". We
understand that it is possible that (a) You may not know what a CPA firm is (b) What kind of messaging to
put on website. We recommend to spend ~15-20 mins on Google, ChatGPT to learn what a CPA firm does
and do your best to attempt the assignment. In real life, it is possible that you will work with different
domain and learning the trade quickly is a skill we are looking for.

Please respond back with a link to the website (built using Framer).
We will evaluate your assessment based on:
1. Does it clear position the firm as a premium boutique firm?
2. Simplicity and elegance in design.
3. Usage of fonts, colors, and creative assets.
